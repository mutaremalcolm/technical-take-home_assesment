## Features

- **Fully Responsive:**
   I wanted ThinkPad to be accessible and user-friendly across various devices. Ensuring a seamless experience for users, whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.

- **Editable Idea Tiles:**
   I developed the ability to edit idea tiles because I believe in the flexibility to refine and evolve ideas. Each tile contains a title and description, empowering users to tailor their thoughts.

- **Focused Title for New Ideas:**
   To streamline the idea creation process, I set the title field to auto-focus for new ideas. This deliberate design choice encourages users to dive right into expressing their thoughts.

- **Sorting Functionality:**
   Recognizing the importance of organization, I implemented sorting options. Users can arrange ideas by creation date or alphabetically, providing a structured view of their ideation journey.

- **LocalStorage Persistence:**
   I implemented localStorage to persist the current state of the application. This ensures that user data is retained even when they refresh the page. I value the convenience of maintaining continuity in idea management.

- **Character Countdown:**
   Acknowledging the significance of concise communication, I added a character countdown. Users receive real-time feedback as they approach the limit of their description text, promoting clarity and brevity.

- **Toast Notifications:**
   For a user-friendly experience, I integrated toast notifications. These notifications promptly inform users of successful updates to an idea tile, enhancing the overall usability of the application.
